Heart Drawing Tweet
===================

A JS1K Submission by Todd Wolfson (2012 Love)
---------------------------------------------

This project is a repository showing the steps I took to creating the tiny script I submitted for JS1K. The key branches to watch are dev/sync\_heart and dev/draw\_heart.

The JS1K hosted demo is available here:

and as a GitHub page here:

Enjoy!
